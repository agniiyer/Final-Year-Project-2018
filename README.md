# Ion-Propulsion-Engines-FYP-2018

Abstract:

Electric propulsion technology generates thrust without any fuel, emissions, moving parts or heat
signature, and is primarily used in deep space exploration and attitude adjustment for satellites.
Given the projected growth in communication satellites that will be in orbit to provide Internet
access to a growing global population, it is a sector that is poised for substantial growth. This
project aims to investigate whether the principles of ion propulsion engines, and more specically
electrohydrodynamic (EHD) propulsion, can be used as a practical source of generating thrust on
Earth. The project begins with a brief history of the technology and an overview and comparison
of the various types of electric thrusters. Hall thrusters and ion thrusters are the most widely
used, so their operating principles have been explained in detail. This is followed by a theoretical
overview of corona discharge and their application in ion propelled aircrafts known as ionocrafts.
The design and construction process of a stationary EHD thruster and an ionocraft are outlined
in detail, followed by extensive testing to verify the effect of varying input power, duty cycle, and
frequency.
